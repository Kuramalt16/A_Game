# Optimization

* insted of recuring loop. only restart the start function before the while loop. recuring loops here are not efficient

* Decreased Character selection processing time from 600 ms to 200 ms ( by adding ranges where to search for color pixels)
* Decreased Character selection processing time from 200 ms to 80 ms  ( by adding dictionaries with preloaded values and variables responsible for shifting positional/color values)
